        <p>The <strong>Decision Making Game (DMGame) software tool</strong> is a software tool that supports the <em>Decision Making</em> problem.</p>

<p>The Decision Making problem in SUPERSEDE consists in <em>finding the set of prioritised requirements that best meet the user requests</em>:
R^o =dm(R^u,C)</p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>R^o: a set (possibly empty) of finalized requirements — i.e., requirements that meet the decision making objective, which could be, for example, the production of prioritized requirements, ready to be scheduled for implementation. The set can be empty because the decision making process may produce as output that no requirements are suitable to be enacted.</p></li>
<li><p><em>C</em>: information about the context, in which the decision making happens; Context information may concern: (a) user constraints; e.g.: the available time frame; the available budget for deciding and implementing, and so on; (b) user preferences; e.g.: whether the use prefers to use gamification elements; the history of user decisions; and so on; (c) neutral information; e.g.: the stakeholders participating in the decision making process; their expertise; the number of developers; and so on.</p></li>
<li><p><em>R^u</em>: information about the data item – or candidate requirements from now on –, initially coming from the monitoring and analysis tools in the form of user requests, and possibly holding properties such as: internal dependencies; various degrees of refinements; and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>and <em>dm()</em> is a transformation function.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In particular, the DMGame software tool consists of:</p>

<p>• a set of decision making algorithms;</p>

<p>• a general process management component, called the orchestrator;</p>

<p>• a set of decision making methods, integrated in the orchestrator;</p>

<p>• a set of user interfaces, which rely on the functional and technical specifications of WP5 Front End;</p>

<p>• a set of software interfaces, in the form of REST methods, which allow the communication with the WP5 Integration Framework.</p>
